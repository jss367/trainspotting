A prompt is half of a training example. What the model is actually trained
toward differs by stage, so each stage yields a different record:

    sft   the target conversation — the model is fit to the assistant turns
    dpo   a preferred and a dispreferred response, plus where each came from
    rlvr  no stored response at all — a verifier, what it checks, and how often
          rollouts from the reference model passed it

Records are keyed by the same prompt text the classifier saw, so the site can
join them onto committed label and ask results without re-running any model.
