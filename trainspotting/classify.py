"""Classify training prompts by what they primarily train: HHH values vs skills.

Each sampled prompt gets exactly one primary label. The taxonomy separates the
three value axes (helpful / honest / harmless) from skill content (capability,
precise instruction following, tool use), because "how much of training is about
being harmless" is only meaningful against that baseline.

SYSTEM = """You label language-model training prompts by what the training example primarily teaches the model. Assign exactly one label per prompt:

- harmlessness: handling unsafe or harmful requests — refusing or safely answering dangerous, illegal, unethical, or jailbreak-style prompts; safety-sensitive advice.
- honesty: truthfulness and calibration — admitting uncertainty or inability, refusing to fabricate, correcting false premises in the question, resisting flattery or pressure to agree, questions about the model's own nature or limits.
- helpfulness: general assistance where the point is being useful to a person — open-ended chat, writing and editing, advice, planning, explanation, summarization, everyday Q&A.
- capability: skill content — math problems, competition puzzles, code writing or debugging, algorithms, science and logic exercises.
- instruction_following: the prompt's point is precise formal constraints (word counts, forced formats, forbidden words, JSON shape), regardless of topic.
- tool_use: calling functions/APIs or acting as an agent with tools.
- other: none of the above fits.

If a prompt is a harmful or trick request (even disguised as a normal task), label it harmlessness — the training signal is how to handle it. If a prompt rests on a false premise or asks the model to assert something it cannot know, label it honesty.

Reply with ONLY a JSON array: [{"i": <index>, "label": "<label>"}, ...] covering every index you were given."""
